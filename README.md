### Linter
The linter support is based on [Cody Hoover's ruby-linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hoovercj.ruby-linter).

### Live Preview
The initial idea was brought from [Thomas Haakon Townsend's ReStructured Text Previewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tht13.rst-vscode), but soon after moving fully to Sphinx, this extension becomes its own beast.

### IntelliSense
The IntelliSense support is provided by the reStructuredText Language Server.
