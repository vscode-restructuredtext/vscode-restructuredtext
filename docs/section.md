# Section Builder
The shortcut is `ctrl+k ctrl+=` (on Mac `cmd+k cmd+=`).

Pressing the shortcut key would convert the current line under the cursor to
a section, by adding adornment (underlines below the title text).

Pressing the shortcut key multiple times switches among the adornment
characters.
